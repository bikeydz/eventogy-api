# eventogy-api

I used for this purpose Laravel framework

Initially created a new laravel project using the comand composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel eventogy-api

then I used HTTP client built in laravel to request data from the api

Show the retrieved data in the view

Apply some styling to the contacts page, also used Bootstrap and Font Awesome libraries

Worked on displaying the full contact profile using Modal

Implemented lazy load using lozadjs library https://github.com/ApoorvSaxena/lozad.js
